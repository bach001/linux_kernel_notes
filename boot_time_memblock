What is memblock?

When programming in kernel space, you cannot use the C standard library memory allocation 
functions available in user space, such as malloc, free, calloc, realloc, or reallocarray.[1] 
There are kernel space equivalents, such as kmalloc or kzalloc, kfree, kcalloc, krealloc_array, 
krealloc,[2] and more. However, these memory allocators are set up during the booting process. 
In the period of time before these allocators are available, the system still needs to allocate 
memory. During that period of time, a specialized allocator called memblock is used to allocate memory.[3]

memblock views the system memory as a collection of contiguous regions. memblock is made up of 
memblock types, which are themselves made up of multiple memory regions. There are several 
structures and functions for working with memblock.[4]
