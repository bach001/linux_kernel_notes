this topic is directly from fixing error related to linux swap(part of linux memory management system)
when compiling embedded linux image using yocto project

about swappiness and memory usage, archwiki is very good source of knowledge as always

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/swap
https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html



very informative question and answers


Why use swap when there is more than enough free space in RAM?

vfs_cache_pressure

This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to 
reclaim the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects.

At the default value of vfs_cache_pressure=100 the kernel 
will attempt to reclaim dentries and inodes at a “fair” 
rate with respect to pagecache and swapcache reclaim. 
Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer 
to retain dentry and inode caches. When vfs_cache_pressure=0, 
the kernel will never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory 
pressure and this can easily lead to out-of-memory conditions. 
Increasing vfs_cache_pressure beyond 100 causes the kernel 
to prefer to reclaim dentries and inodes.

Increasing vfs_cache_pressure significantly beyond 100 may 
have negative performance impact. Reclaim code needs to 
take various locks to find freeable directory and inode 
objects. With vfs_cache_pressure=1000, it will look for 
ten times more freeable objects than there are.
